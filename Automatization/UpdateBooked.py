# The code checks if the user table in the SQL database had any manual modifications. This is whether a field was updated or a user was
# deleted from the table. For the code to work we had to add two triggers on the SQL database; see the documentation file of this script for
# more detailed information. If there was any modification in the table, the script updates the relevant fields in Booked. If the user was deleted
# from the table, the user is also removed from Booked.
